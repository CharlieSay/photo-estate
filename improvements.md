## 3. Code Organization Improvements

### Suggested File Structure
```
src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── common/        # Shared components
  │   ├── features/      # Feature-specific components
  │   ├── layouts/       # Layout components
  │   └── ui/           # UI components
  ├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
  ├── lib/
  │   ├── api/          # API related code
  │   ├── constants/    # Constants and configurations
  │   ├── stores/       # State management
  │   └── utils/        # Utility functions
  └── types/            # TypeScript types
```

### Suggested Improvements
1. Move business logic from components to custom hooks
2. Create separate feature folders for major functionality
3. Implement proper error boundaries
